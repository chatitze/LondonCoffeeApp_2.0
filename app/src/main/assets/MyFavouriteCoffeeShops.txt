A rough concrete column, brick wall and exposed ceiling utilities pleasingly mix the raw with the cooked. And that's before we even get to the coffee.\nYes, the coffee. Near-enough perfect, my flat white with the newest Cult of Done was rich, velvety, darkly fruity, and good enough to drown in. Beautifully and carefully constructed.\nThe staff were friendly and unobtrusive, and happy to take me through the other coffee possibilities - Aeropress (with other hand filters to come in time), and batch brew.\nThe food offering is short and sweet, much like that at Workshop's Marylebone shop: simple baguette sandwiches assembled in the kitchen downstairs, and a few pastries, muffins and brownies sourced from Yeast, Little Bread Pedlar and Sally White.\nGo, go - it's really quite marvellous.\""},

I had a piccolo in an oversize glass (no criticism), which was smooth and chocolate, a suitably tasty rendering of Climpson’s tried and tested Estate blend. I also tried a single origin Kenyan Kiangoi, again by Climpson, as a filter.\nThe service was sharp and friendly, chattily congenial but also efficient. The coffee is already very good and the sort of teething problems cafés often, understandably encounter just didn’t seem to be present. These guys are on point and power to them for it.

In the other hand, locals hold their fresh coffee.\nOnly using beans certified as 80 or above on the tasting table, Andrea and Michelle serve London Fields’s own Climpson’s & Sons roasts to keep things local; but the freshness is representative of the cafe’s geographical muse, South America.\nBreakfast arepas are filled with egg and bacon, or a Venezuelan pastry chef arrives each morning with lighter options if you’re popping in on the move.\""}],
