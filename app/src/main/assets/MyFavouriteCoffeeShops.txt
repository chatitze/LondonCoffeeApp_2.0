Happily, you don’t need to fear ordering a plain espresso here; avoiding the extremes of long roasting time leaves the beans with flavours of berries and dark chocolate. Filter brews from a changing roster of beans are well made and well suited to more leisurely sipping. Food is a strong point.

A rough concrete column, brick wall and exposed ceiling utilities pleasingly mix the raw with the cooked. And that's before we even get to the coffee.\nYes, the coffee. Near-enough perfect, my flat white with the newest Cult of Done was rich, velvety, darkly fruity, and good enough to drown in. Beautifully and carefully constructed.\nThe staff were friendly and unobtrusive, and happy to take me through the other coffee possibilities - Aeropress (with other hand filters to come in time), and batch brew.\nThe food offering is short and sweet, much like that at Workshop's Marylebone shop: simple baguette sandwiches assembled in the kitchen downstairs, and a few pastries, muffins and brownies sourced from Yeast, Little Bread Pedlar and Sally White.\nGo, go - it's really quite marvellous.\""},

Made with single-estate beans from Uganda, our espresso was distinctive, roasted with care and a welcome sidestep away from the high-roasted house blend. Coffee with milk has never been a problem, and both a flat white and a piccolo were spot-on. The food menu is small but sound. Decor and seating are basic, and the place can feel cramped when busy. But at quieter times, Flat White is bliss – especially if the weather is good and you can bag a seat outside.\""}],

It’s an unpretentious but attractively decorated spot, with a soothing colour scheme (grey with touches of yellow), retro furnishings and jolly pictures on the long flank wall. Fanatically skilled but socially casual, the staff in attendance always seem to include at least one of the two owners. They make the place buzz with their evident enthusiasm for coffee, catering and customers.\nYou’ll almost always find a mixed crowd, right down to babies and toddlers. Outstanding baked goods include a warm banana bread, which regulars reckon is irresistible. Sandwiches are equally good. And the coffee? Well, if you like espresso, you’ll love this place – heaven in a tiny cup, using Climpson & Sons beans. The baristas tend their machines as if they were Maseratis, and that attention to detail pretty much sums up everything that Birdhouse does.\""},

The coffee is Climpson and Sons, always likely to earn an approving nod from my palate. I had a piccolo in an oversize glass (no criticism), which was smooth and chocolate, a suitably tasty rendering of Climpson’s tried and tested Estate blend. I also tried a single origin Kenyan Kiangoi, again by Climpson, as a filter.\nThe service was sharp and friendly, chattily congenial but also efficient. The coffee is already very good and the sort of teething problems cafés often, understandably encounter just didn’t seem to be present. These guys are on point and power to them for it. So, while those of you who visit N16 might already have your favourites, I would commend Yellow Warbler to you for a visit.\""},

The leasing agent, the baristas, the plumbers and even the surveyors that helped bring it to life all live on Andrea and Michelle’s street in Hackney.\nThe locals were enlisted to build a foreign getaway in Stoke Newington that attributes the cultures of all over South America, but particularly Venezuela. The Venezuelan arepas are the stars of the show – they’re warmed cornflour rolls filled with red meaty goodness like pulled pork, and topped off with beans and plantain. In the other hand, locals hold their fresh coffee.\nOnly using beans certified as 80 or above on the tasting table, Andrea and Michelle serve London Fields’s own Climpson’s & Sons roasts to keep things local; but the freshness is representative of the cafe’s geographical muse, South America.\nBreakfast arepas are filled with egg and bacon, or a Venezuelan pastry chef arrives each morning with lighter options if you’re popping in on the move.\""}],
